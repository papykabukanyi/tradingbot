# Alpaca Trading Bot - Security Best Practices

## Environment Variables

This trading bot uses environment variables to secure sensitive information like API keys and credentials. 

### Local Development

For local development:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your API keys and credentials
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control

```bash
# Create your .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your favorite editor
nano .env
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment on Railway:
1. Set all environment variables in the Railway dashboard
2. See `RAILWAY_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

## Configuration Management

All environment variables are centralized in the `src/config.js` module which:
- Validates required environment variables on startup
- Provides default values for optional settings
- Exposes a clean configuration API for the application

## API Keys Security

The following sensitive values are stored as environment variables:
- Alpaca API key and secret
- News API key
- Email SMTP credentials

These are never hardcoded in the application and are accessed only through the configuration module.

## Error Handling & Logging

The application uses:
- Graceful error handling to prevent leaking sensitive information
- Careful logging practices to avoid exposing secrets in logs
- Emergency alerts that do not include sensitive information

## Source Control Precautions

The repository is protected by:
- `.gitignore` rules to prevent committing sensitive files
- Example configuration files instead of actual credentials
- Documentation on secure setup practices

## Additional Security Features

The application implements:
- Helmet.js for secure HTTP headers
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Content Security Policy for the dashboard

## Best Practices

- Rotate API keys periodically
- Use paper trading for testing
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Limit trading permissions to only what's needed
